README

Hi, this is Leonardo speaking. I don't know how you find this piece of
software but you should know that it comes with absolutely no waranty.


INSTALLING

To install please download ruby on rails from
http://www.rubyonrails.org and install.

Windows
	First: you really should think about getting linux running, but if you are
	really sure you want to do this then do the following:
	
	Install ruby from the link:
	http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/29263/ruby186-26.exe
	(take note on the ruby install folder)
	
	Download Sqlite3 dll from http://www.sqlite.org/download.html
	Look for "sqlitedll-*.zip". Unpack on ruby "bin" folder.
	
	Then you have to update your ruby-gems with the command:
	c:\> gem update --system
	
	After go to ruby prompt and install rails, a ruby framework for web 
	development and mongrel (this is optional) with the command:
	c:\> gem install rails mongrel sqlite3-ruby

	To run the server execute the command-line
	c:\> ruby script\server

	
MAC
	Install rubygems from rubyonrails website.
	my_user@localhost: 


Linux
	If you are a linux user you should already know what to do, but if you
	don't, on ruby on rails website there is a nice how to install rails.
	When you finish go to the project folder and execute:
	./code/script/server


	
	
UTILITIES
	For now there is no interface to add categories and subcategories, this
	should be done directly by SQLite. A nice application to do this is 
	the firefox plugin "SQLite Manager".
	
	
NOTES

- Only tested with ruby186-26 on windows
